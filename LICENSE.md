This Alter SDK License Agreement, ("Agreement"), is a binding
agreement between you and Omnipresence Inc., a Delaware corporation

Development Kit means any SDK, including our Alter SDK, I/O SDK
andbany application programming interfaces, plugins, code, technology,
tools documentation, specification and content made available by us
to others (collectively, the “SDK”).

The SDK and other products offered by Alter are considered
intellectual property, as defined below and marked as assets
of Alter (“Assets”). If you, as a third party (“Provider”)
through your Application, as defined below, offer and distribute
Assets  and an end-user (“End-User”) acquires a license to an Asset
from us, this License Agreement shall apply regardless of whether
the asset is produced by us or by you, as a Provider and licensor.

Your use is expressly conditioned on your acceptance of the Agreement
contained herein and confirmation that you comply with the terms by
clicking the “Accept” button below. By accepting, you are agreeing with
other applicable terms and conditions of the Alter Studio, our Terms
of Service and acknowledging our Privacy Policy. This Agreement, the

non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, worldwide, revocable
right and license to use and reproduce the SDK solely to develop,
test or distribute your Application (defined below) and to enable you
and/or your end user access to Alter features, including but not
limited to, facial tracking technology and user created avatars through
your Application.

The license granted is solely for the purpose of testing, developing
and promoting your applications, content, games, demos or other products
and features (“Application’) and providing end users access to Alter
features and services through your Application.

The SDK may include sample source code, libraries or other materials

that you may display to your end users, including avatars. The SDK
documentation will indicate such use and you may incorporate,
reproduce and distribute them as part of your Application.

allow Alter access to the pre-release versions of the Applications
through third party applications.

to such Asset.  In such a case, only you, as the Provider (as opposed to

license agreement or any breach by the Provider. End Users may use the
licensed Assets only for their intended purpose and only under the same
